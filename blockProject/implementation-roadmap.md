## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
- **Blockchain Gas Costs**: Implement layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum)
- **Scalability Issues**: Use microservices architecture with horizontal scaling
- **Data Consistency**: Implement robust synchronization mechanisms

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Focus on farmer-friendly interfaces and offline capabilities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Engage with food safety authorities early
- **Cost Management**: Optimize for low-cost deployment options

### Security Risks
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits
- **Data Privacy**: Implement proper encryption and access controls
- **Key Management**: Use hardware security modules for production keys
